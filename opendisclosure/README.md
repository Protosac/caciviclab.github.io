Open Disclosure - CA Civic Lab
========================

OpenDisclosure is a platform for organizing campaign finance data that can be replicated and scaled throughout the state of California.

## Where do I meet you?

We are collaborating across the state of california.  There are both weekly and monthly meetings which will appear on the [google calendar.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencal)

We also listen to issues here on github, meet up to talk about them in [slack](https://opencal.slack.com), and use [trello](https://trello.com/b/StoAokyX) to organize collective efforts. 

## How You Can Help

* If you are in the area, check out a [meeting.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencal)
* If you are remote, then come visit us on [slack.](https://opencal.slack.com)
* If you want to avoid the business of discussing with people - we want you!  Pull the repo, make some changes, and tell us about it with a github [issue.](https://github.com/opencalifornia/issues)
* Say you are a fan, who just really wants to lurk and cheer us on.  View the [alpha.](https://caciviclab.com/disclosure)
